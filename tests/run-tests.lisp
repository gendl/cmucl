;;;; Main script to run all of the tests in the tests directory.
;;;; It is intended to be run using something like
;;;;
;;;;   lisp -noinit -load tests/run-tests.lisp -eval '(cmucl-test-runner:run-all-tests)'
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; To run selected tests:
;;;;
;;;;   lisp -noinit -load tests/run-tests.lisp -eval '(progn (cmucl-test-runner:load-test-files) (cmucl-test-runner:run-test <list>))'
;;;;
;;;; Note that you cannot run these tests from a binary created during
;;;; a build process. You must run
;;;;
;;;;   bin/make-dist.sh -I inst-dir build-dir
;;;;
;;;; to install everything in some temporary directory. This is needed
;;;; because the simple-streams test needs to load simple-streams, and
;;;; the build directory isn't set up for that.
;;;;
;;;; The exit code indicates whether there were any test failures.  A
;;;; non-zero code indicates a failure of some sort.
