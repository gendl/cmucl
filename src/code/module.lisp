;;;; Provide and Require.

(defun provide (module-name)
  "Adds a new module name to *modules* indicating that it has been
  loaded.  Module-name may be any valid string designator.  All
  comparisons are done using string=, i.e. module names are
  case-sensitive."

  t)

(defun require (module-name &optional pathname)
  "Loads a module when it has not been already.  Pathname, if
  supplied, is a single pathname or list of pathnames to be loaded if
  the module needs to be.  If pathname is not supplied, then functions
  from the list *MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS* are called in order with
  the stringified MODULE-NAME as the argument, until one of them
  returns non-NIL.  By default the functions
  MODULE-PROVIDE-CMUCL-DEFMODULE and MODULE-PROVIDE- CMUCL-LIBRARY are
  on this list of functions, in that order.  The first of those looks
  for a list of files that was registered by a EXT:DEFMODULE form.  If
  the module has not been defined, then the second function causes a
  file to be loaded whose name is formed by merging \"modules:\" and
  the concatenation of module-name with the suffix \"-LIBRARY\".  Note
  that both the module-name and the suffix are each, separately,
  converted from :case :common to :case :local.  This merged name will
  be probed with both a .lisp and .fasl extensions, calling LOAD if it
  exists.

  Note that in all cases covered above, user code is responsible for
  calling PROVIDE to indicate a successful load of the module.

  While loading any files, *load-verbose* is bound to *require-verbose*
  which defaults to t.

  The predefined modules included are :defsystem, :asdf, :lisp-unit,
  :unix, :clx, :clm, :hemlock, and :cmu-contribs.

  The module :cmu-contribs differs from the other modules in that
  requiring this module only defines the following modules:
  \"contrib-demos\", \"contrib-follow-mouse\",
  \"contrib-games-feebs\", \"contrib-hist\", \"contrib-psgraph\",
  \"contrib-ops\", \"contrib-embedded-c\", \"contrib-sprof\", and
  \"contrib-packed-sse2\". "

  ;; load easily the contribs that use asdf.  There are no contribs
  ;; that use defsystem, so we won't autoload defsystem.
