;; Implementation notes.
;;
;; The string-foldcase, string-downcase, and string-titlecase
;; procedures rely on the notion of a word, which is defined
;; by Unicode Standard Annex 29.
;;
;; The string-foldcase and string-downcase procedures rely on
;; word boundaries only when they encounter a Greek sigma, so
;; their performance should not be greatly affected by the
;; performance of the word-breaking algorithm.
;;
;; The string-titlecase procedure must find all word boundaries,
;; but it is typically used on short strings (titles).
;;
;; Hence the performance of the word-breaking algorithm should
;; not matter too much for this reference implementation.
;; Word-breaking is more generally useful, however, so I tried
;; to make this implementation reasonably efficient.
;;
;; Word boundaries are defined by 14 different rules in
;; Unicode Standard Annex #29, and by GraphemeBreakProperty.txt
;; and WordBreakProperty.txt.  See also WordBreakTest.html.
;;
;; My original implementation of those specifications failed
;; 6 of the 494 tests in auxiliary/WordBreakTest.txt, but it
;; appeared to me that those tests were inconsistent with the
;; word-breaking rules in UAX #29.  John Cowan forwarded my
;; bug report to the Unicode experts, and Mark Davis responded
;; on 29 May 2007:
;;
;;   Thanks for following up on this. I think you have found a problem in the
;;   formulation of word break, not the test. The intention was to break after a
;;   Sep character, as is done in Sentence break. So my previous suggestion was
;;   incorrect; instead, what we need is a new rule:
;; 
;;   *Break after paragraph separators.*
;;    WB3a. Sep ï¿½
;;   I'll make a propose to the UTC for this.
;;
;; Here is Will's translation of those rules (including WB3a)
;; into a finite state machine that searches forward within a
;; string, looking for the next position at which a word break
;; is allowed.  The current state consists of an index i into
;; the string and a summary of the left context whose rightmost
;; character is at index i.  The left context is usually
;; determined by the character at index i, but there are three
;; complications:
;;
;;     Extend and Format characters are ignored unless they
;;         follow a separator or the beginning of the text.
;;     ALetter followed by MidLetter is treated specially.
;;     Numeric followed by MidNum is treated specially.
;;
;; In the implementation below, the left context ending at i
;; is encoded by the following symbols:
;;
;;     CR
;;     Sep (excluding CR)
;;     ALetter
;;     MidLetter
;;     ALetterMidLetter (ALetter followed by MidLetter)
;;     Numeric
;;     MidNum
;;     NumericMidNum (Numeric followed by MidNum)
;;     Katakana
;;     ExtendNumLet
;;     other (none of the above)
;;
;; Given a string s and an exact integer i (which need not be
;; a valid index into s), returns the index of the next character
;; that is not part of the word containing the character at i,
;; or the length of s if the word containing the character at i
;; extends through the end of s.  If i is negative or a valid
;; index into s, then the returned value will be greater than i.
