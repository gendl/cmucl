  "This function sets options controlling the floating-point hardware.  If a

   :TRAPS
       A list of the exception conditions that should cause traps.  Possible
       exceptions are :UNDERFLOW, :OVERFLOW, :INEXACT, :INVALID,
       :DIVIDE-BY-ZERO, and on the X86 :DENORMALIZED-OPERAND. Initially
       all traps except :INEXACT are enabled.

   :ROUNDING-MODE
       The rounding mode to use when the result is not exact.  Possible values
       are :NEAREST, :POSITIVE-INFINITY, :NEGATIVE-INFINITY and :ZERO.
       Initially, the rounding mode is :NEAREST.

   :CURRENT-EXCEPTIONS
   :ACCRUED-EXCEPTIONS
       These arguments allow setting of the exception flags.  The main use is
       setting the accrued exceptions to NIL to clear them.

   :FAST-MODE
       Set the hardware's \"fast mode\" flag, if any.  When set, IEEE
       conformance or debuggability may be impaired.  Some machines may not
       have this feature, in which case the value is always NIL.
