;;;; tail-call-variable.

;;; For tail-call-variable, we have to copy the arguments from the end of our
;;; stack frame (where args are produced) to the start of our stack frame
;;; (where args are expected).
;;;
;;; We take the function to call in rAX and a pointer to the arguments in
;;; rSI.  rBP says the same over the jump, and the old frame pointer is
;;; still saved in the first stack slot.  The return-pc is saved in
;;; the second stack slot, so we have to push it to make it look like
;;; we actually called.  We also have to compute rCX from the difference
;;; between rSI and the stack top.
