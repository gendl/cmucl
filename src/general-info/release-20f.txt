[In Progress]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20f.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements
 
  * Changes
    * Update to ASDF 3.0.3.
    * When *PRINT-CASE* is :DOWNCASE, integers are printed with
      lowercase letters when needed.
    * Micro-optimize KERNEL:DOUBLE-FLOAT-BITS for x86/sse2.
    * Add micro-optimization for unary FTRUNCATE for x86/sse2.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:

  * Bugfixes:


  * Trac Tickets:

  * Other changes:

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20e; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cmucl.org> or
<URL:http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
